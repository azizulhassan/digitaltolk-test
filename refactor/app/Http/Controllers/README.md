## What is Good

1. The controller uses dependency injection, which is good because it promotes loose coupling and facilitates testing.

2. The controller makes use of namespaces and use statements, enhancing code organization and class reference clarity.

3. The code also utilizes Eloquent for database operations, which is a recommended practice.

---

## What can be Improved

1. The length of the functions can be reduced by breaking them into smaller, related pieces of code. This promotes code readability and maintainability.

2. Consider using ternary operators to simplify multiple if-else statements and improve code readability.

3. Adding comments to methods and important code blocks would enhance code understandability.

4. Address inconsistencies in the code to maintain a uniform coding style.

5. Implement FormRequest validation rules to separate concerns, and ensure that validation is handled before data is passed to the repository.

6. Improve variable naming for better self-explanatory code.

---

## What is Bad

1. The controller is named 'BookingController,' but the code mentions 'Jobs' several times. Consider renaming the controller to 'JobsController' for consistency.

2. The controller lacks validation rules, which can lead to potential security vulnerabilities and data integrity issues.

3. There is a lack of proper exception handling in the code.

4. Validation rules are missing, further increasing the risk of invalid data entering the system.

5. The code contains redundant segments that should be refactored or removed for improved efficiency and clarity.

6. Some methods have implicit returns. It's better to be explicit about what the method returns for clarity.

7. The class violates single responsibility principle because some of the functions for example **distanceFeed** is doing database operation which should be manages in repository.
